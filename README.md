The summer of 2021 I finally got fed up with my crappy ikea kitchen timer and decided to build my own. 

Here's the bill of materials I ended up with:   
[Teensy 2.0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/199)

[Adafruit 16x9 Charlieplexed PWM LED Matrix Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2946)  
[LED Charlieplexed Matrix - 9x16 LEDs - Warm White](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3162)  

[Rotary Encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/377)  
[Solid Machined Metal Knob](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2056)  

[PowerBoost 500 Charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1944)  
[Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 2500mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/328)  

[Mini Magnet Feet for RGB LED Matrices](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4631)  
[Piezo Buzzer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/160)  

I supplemented some additional fasteners to screw into the mini magnet feet from the front clamping the case layers together. 

The [schematic](assets/fritzing-schematic.png) is available in the assets folder, as is the [templates I used to laser cut the enclosure](assets/lasercut-case.svg) from 3mm acrylic.
